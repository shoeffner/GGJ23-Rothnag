## Game concept

Old one: Rothnag'Ka Trk
- Huge tree next to a small house
- Tree needs to be taken care off by main character
- Has certain needs:
    - Watering
    - Raking leaves
    - Cutting
    - Fighting off pests
    - ...
- Roots growing towards the house whenever the tree is angry / not taken care off fast enough
- Game is lost once the roots reach the house and the world will be devoured
- Game gets more difficult over time (more needs to be satisfied, less time to satisfy, etc.)
